```

Our solution supports multiple model providers including Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and custom enterprise endpoints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Perplexica Integration Setup

The Perplexica knowledge retrieval system significantly enhances Agent S capabilities through web-knowledge integration:

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed on your enterprise system

2. Set up the Perplexica module:

   ```bash
   cd Perplexica
   git submodule update --init
   ```

3. Configure the `enterprise.config.toml` file with your organization's API credentials:

   - `OPENAI`: Your enterprise OpenAI API key
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your enterprise Anthropic API key
   - `AZURE_OPENAI`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint and key
   - `ENTERPRISE_ENDPOINT`: Your custom model endpoint (if applicable)

4. Deploy the Perplexica service:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f enterprise-compose.yaml up -d
   ```

5. Configure Agent S to use your Perplexica endpoint:

   ```bash
   export PERPLEXICA_URL=http://localhost:{port}/api/search
   ```

For enterprise-specific customizations of the Perplexica API, refer to our [Enterprise Integration Guide](https://github.com/AstridNielsen-lab/Agent-S-Like-Look-IA/wiki/enterprise-integration).
